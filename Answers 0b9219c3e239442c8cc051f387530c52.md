Task 4

Answer the questions below

How do we copy a line?

Submit

To copy a line in Vim, you can use the `yy` command. This command yanks (copies) the current line, allowing you to paste it elsewhere in the file. Here's how to do it:

1. **Ensure You Are in Normal Mode:**
If you are not sure, press `Esc` to switch to normal mode.
2. **Copy the Line:**
Type `yy` (short for yank line) and press `Enter`.

This command copies the entire current line.

### Example Workflow

Suppose you have the following lines in your file:

```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3

```

1. **Open the file in Vim:**
    
    ```
    vim example.txt
    
    ```
    
2. **Ensure You Are in Normal Mode:**
    - Press `Esc` to ensure you are in normal mode.
3. **Copy a Line:**
    - Position the cursor on the line you want to copy (e.g., "Line 2").
    - Type `yy` and press `Enter`.

The line "Line 2" is now copied and ready to be pasted.

To paste the copied line, move the cursor to the desired location and use the `p` command to paste after the cursor or `P` to paste before the cursor. For example:

- To paste after the cursor: Type `p` and press `Enter`.
- To paste before the cursor: Type `P` and press `Enter`.

To copy two lines in Vim, you can use the following steps:

1. **Ensure You Are in Normal Mode:**
If you are not sure, press `Esc` to switch to normal mode.
2. **Navigate to the Starting Line:**
Move the cursor to the first line you want to copy.
3. **Enter Visual Line Mode:**
    - Press `Shift + V` to enter visual line mode. This mode allows you to select entire lines.
4. **Select the Lines:**
    - Move the cursor down to the second line you want to copy. This will highlight both lines.
5. **Copy the Lines:**
    - Press `y` (yank) to copy the selected lines.

The selected lines are now copied and can be pasted elsewhere in the file using the `p` command (paste).

### Example Workflow

```
1. First line
2. Second line

    - Move the cursor to line 3 ("Line to copy 1").
4. **Enter Visual Line Mode and Select Lines:**
