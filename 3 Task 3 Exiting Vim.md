First of all,

Congratulations!

You can now type in, utilise functions of and move around in a Vim document! Congratulations. You're now an order of magnitude more capable than you were before! Remember, repetition is key so keep going!

**Now lets learn how to exit vim...**

There are six ways to exit vim, hold on, don't run away. They are:

- write the file, but don't exit [equivalent to save]
- ^ as root
- write and quit [equivalent to save and exit]
- quit [fails if there is unsaved changes]
- force quit [will exit with unsaved changes]
- save and quit [all active tabs]

**Guide**

I suggest making a small learning directory, and writing a few small documents, in Vim of course, to test these out on- if you get stuck, there's the help guide outlined in the last task- or you can use google.
